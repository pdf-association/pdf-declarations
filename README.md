# **PDF Declarations: JSON definitions**

This repo contains a JSON definition for all PDF Declarations recognized by the PDF Association and as published on this page: https://pdfa.org/declarations/

The JSON strings provide standardized text for use in identifying PDF Declarations in user interfaces. In each string, the key is the
URI for a PDF Declaration and the value is the PDF Association's display string intended for use in software UIs.

If you want to add a PDF Declaration to the PDF Association's <a href="https://pdfa.org/declarations/">
